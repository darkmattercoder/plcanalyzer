== Usage instructions ==

On startup you will see a window where you have different elements.
If you ran the program before, you might notice that there are some operand value fields visible in the main window.
Those value fields are saved on any program close event and restored on startup.

You get three buttons at the top of the window:

* "Connection settings" gives you a nice UI where you can make your desired connection settings as well as specify the operands
  that you want to read
* "Connect" makes the application try to connect to a physically present PLC. The Button reads "Disconnect" when connected
* "Read slots" triggers the value reading from the PLC when triggered. Once pressed, the graph display in the middle of the
  window will start to display a graphical representation of whatever it reads. The current values are displayed as well in the
  value fields in the lower right.

Under the graph display you find an auto scale-button to rescale a graph if needed. With the "duration"-field you can specify the
time shown on one bottom axis length.

Right beside you find a button which cleans the graph display.

The Log window at the bottom of the main window shows you some debug information.

The "File"-menu entry allows you to open and save a project as well as create a new one.
The Help entry shows this documentation.
