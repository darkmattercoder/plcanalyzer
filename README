PLC Analyzer 1.0
===========

PLC Analyzer gives you a possibility to display and record values read out from a plc. 
Using libnodave you are able to connect to most SIEMENS S5 and S7 PLCs.

Programm is tested on Windows 7 and Linux (Ubuntu 12.04).

== Compile instructions for PlcAnalyzer v.1.0 ==

On Windows and Linux be sure to have the QT-Libraries installed on your machine. You will at least need QT 4.8.2.
Get it from http://qt-project.org
Just open the plcanalyzer directory and in a terminal type "qmake" (Regarding any possibly leading paths), then "nmake" (or "make" on Linux).
And the application will build.

If you have an instance of qt creator running, you can now just start the application from the ide which will work fine.
However there is a small issue with the shared libraries in the subdirectory "lib". If you try to execute the application from the
command line, you will end up with linux or windows complaining about the missing libraries.

Therefore please do the following steps:

- On Windows, simply copy the dlls into the folder where the plcanalyzer-gui.exe is located.
- On Linux, open a terminal and relocate to the path with the executable.
  Then change the "LD_LIBRARY_PATH": `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:./lib/;`

Run the application by executing either "plcanalyzer.exe" (Win) or "./plcanalyzer" (Linux).

== Usage ==

You can find a small program description in the "USAGE"-File in the Directory as well as by chosing the "Help"-menu entry.

== Additional notes ==

Please note that plc analyzer is a young software project which might have some nasty glitches here and there and therefore
should only be used in a safe environment. If you are using it in a productional environment, you have to have explicit
knowledge of what you are doing.
